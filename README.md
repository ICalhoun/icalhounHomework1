The production function in this program is called calculate_total. It calculates the total of a list of items to be purchased. It does not do refunds, it only adds up the total value of the items including sales tax for the states of Massachusetts, Maine and Connecticut, depending on which state is selected.

In order to run the tests for this program go to the directory that the project is in and enter:

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt 
```


then run the tests by entering:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
